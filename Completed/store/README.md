We are using HTMl, CSS, and Javascript in order to make a page that diplays items in a table. Then we take user input for the quantity of the items. Finally we caluclate the total cost of the items.

JS architecture
    class Item
    constructor Item
        name
        cost 
        imagename

    make objects with the item class
    method that shows the items in a table
    method that takes in user input for the cost of the items and then calulates the total cost of the items and outputs it
